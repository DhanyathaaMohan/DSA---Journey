Leetcode 543.Diameter of a binary tree 

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

At every node, the longest path passing through that node is:
        leftHeight + rightHeight
The maximum of this over all nodes is the diameter.

Optimal DFS Solution (One Traversal)

class Solution {
    int diameter = 0;

    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        height(root);
        return diameter;
    }

    int height(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        int left = height(node.left);
        int right = height(node.right);

        // Update diameter at this node
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, left + right);

        // Return height
        return 1 + Math.max(left, right);
    }
}
