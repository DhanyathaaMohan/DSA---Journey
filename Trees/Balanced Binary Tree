Leetcode 110. Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

At each node:
  Compute height of left subtree
  Compute height of right subtree
  Check height difference ≤ 1
If any node violates this → tree is NOT balanced 

Optimal Recursive Solution (Bottom-Up)
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        return height(root) != -1;
    }

    int height(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        int left = height(node.left);
        if (left == -1) return -1;

        int right = height(node.right);
        if (right == -1) return -1;

        if (Math.abs(left - right) > 1)
            return -1;

        return 1 + Math.max(left, right);
    }
}
