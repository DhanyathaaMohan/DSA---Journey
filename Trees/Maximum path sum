Leetcode 124.Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

At each node:
  You can choose left OR right OR none (if negative)
  A path that continues upward can include only one side
  A path that ends here can include both sides

So we track:
  Max gain to parent (returned value)
  Global maximum path sum (answer)

Optimal DFS Solution (One Traversal)

class Solution {
    int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        maxGain(root);
        return maxSum;
    }

    int maxGain(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        // Ignore negative paths
        int left = Math.max(0, maxGain(node.left));
        int right = Math.max(0, maxGain(node.right));

        // Path passing through this node
        int currentPath = node.val + left + right;

        // Update global maximum
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentPath);

        // Return max path going up
        return node.val + Math.max(left, right);
    }
}
