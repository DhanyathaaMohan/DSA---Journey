A tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure composed of nodes (which store data) connected by edges (links).
It is a specialized form of a graph that has no cycles and a single designated root node at the top

Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once in a specific order.
The two primary classifications are Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), each with different variants. 

Depth-First Search (DFS)
  1.Pre-order Traversal
  2.In-order Traversal
  3.Post-order Traversal
Breadth First Search (BFS)
  1.Level Order Traversal
